                        The target audience of Weather Reporter are the local people that 
                        live in the areas of Preston, Fish Haven, and Soda Springs. These 
                        individuals will be able to access this website to find information 
                        on the weather as well as events that may be happening in the area.
                        It will also provide information to people who plan on visiting 
                        these areas for vacations. Those vacationing here will likely be 
                        in the middle class, averaging $50,000 per year and will likely 
                        range from single people to small families with 2-4 children. The 
                        services on this website will be useable from a mobile phone,

                                Sharon and her husband like to travel. She is 
                                a few years older than her husband and has a degree 
                                in psychology. Her body temperature has always been 
                                different from that of her husband. While he can usually 
                                muscle through a chilly evening, she likes to check 
                                the weather to make sure she knows what temperatures 
                                to prepare for and how thick of a jacket to bring. She 
                                would use her phone to access the weather.

                                Mike and Stacy have been married for 12 years and have 4 children. 
                                The oldest one in 11 and the youngest one is five. They have already 
                                had situations arise from vacations in which one or more of the children 
                                have been sun-burned or lost their jacket. They now like to check the 
                                weather sites in the local areas they will be visiting to be sure that 
                                they have the necessary equipment for the trip. They might check the 
                                weather from their phone or from their laptop.
